# Hi ðŸ‘‹ !
I'm Ismail Bilge
I am a new programmer, full-stack developer. I can describe myself as a hard-working, solution-oriented and willing to learn teammate.
This my GitHub page has materials about HTML, CSS, JS, React, Python, Python Libraries, Web Development, and some other topics. I am trying to improve myself. And at the same time I am adding my projects here to reach them when i need, and also maybe they can be helpful for others.
